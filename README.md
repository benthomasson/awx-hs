Experiments in Scale and Performance


The goal of this project to build an API and database compatible version of AWX
that can scale to a large number of concurrent jobs and API requests on low end
hardware with minimal infrastructure.  This is not a fork of AWX.  It is a drop
in replacement for the AWX API.
